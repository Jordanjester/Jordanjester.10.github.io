<P>"There is no reason and no way that a human mind can keep up with an artificial intelligence machine by 2035.” – Gray Scott. Perhaps the most high-level technology that’s ever created, the so called AI or Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful technical advancement that is transforming the world by enabling machines to carry out cognitive tasks including perception, reasoning, learning, and interaction. (Ergen, 2019). This explains that Artificial intelligence is a powerful technology that can do certain amount of task for humans to make their task easier and accurate, this includes Generative AI. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a distinct class of artificial intelligence and incredibly powerful technology popularized by ChatGPT. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is one of it. It gained one million users in five days and reached 100 million users two months after its launch in November 2022, setting the record for the fastest growing consumer app (Lim, 2023). As we all know ChatGPT is the most popular AI bots that’s been active for the past 2 years, it attracted humans because of its capability of dealing with challenging language understanding, and generation tasks in the form of conversations. 
The continuous improvement of Generative Artificial Intelligence is extraordinary. The amount of Generative Artificial intelligence Tools that are built nowadays is incredibly rising. It keeps improving its capability of doing tasks more and much accurate. According to Google.com, it said that there are nearly 300 AI tools nowadays. Each of them has a capability of doing certain things according to the person’s needs, with just a simple conversation with an AI. It can automatically do it for what you exactly you want it to be. These tools enables humans to increase their learning effectiveness, offer them personalized learning assistance, and automate their administrative duties (Wang et al., 2023; Zhang, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Which basically means Generative Artificial Intelligence can be a really helpful tools to support humans who has difficulty do a certain tasks, example for some students, with the help of Generative Artificial intelligence. It improves their comprehension in subjects, and to have a quicker answers although for some seeing it as a tool for personalized learning and to improve their education while for other they see it as cheating while examining or doing assignments. This study shows the importance and risks of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in educational system.
This study aims is to demonstrates the highly effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence among humans, in education and in technology, and also to investigate its capabilities. This study tells that generative artificial intelligence can be a valuable time-saving tool for humans. Although there are still negativity using it there are more likely positives because of its capable of producing media such as text, images, and audio in response to prompts."</p>
